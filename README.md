# Fermat Last Theorem debunked
#### very short explanation  
powers of number are just like natural numbers, (period)  
(as if they had been written in the form n<sup>1</sup>)  
  
in natural numbers, you can sum any of them to produce any other, (of course)    
just because in the domain of the power of 1 , leaves all gaps equal to 1  
  
in the domain of power of two,  you are summing squares which leaves gaps of 1,3,5,7 ...  
in the domain of power of two,  you are summing squares which leaves gaps of 1,7,19,37 ...  
and so forth ..
